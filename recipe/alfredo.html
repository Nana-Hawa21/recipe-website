        <h3 class="sec4">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages thin spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped broccoli (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sec5">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
            <li>You can replace fresh onion with more onion powder, if preferred.</li>
            
        </ol>
