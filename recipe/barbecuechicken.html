        <h1>Description</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken, into halves</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup barbeque sauce, or as needed</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half; 2 cuts in each breast, 2 in the thigh, and 1 on the leg; remove wing tips.</li>
            <li>Whisk rice vinegar, barbeque sauce, and garlic together in large bowl. Place chicken in bowl and turn to coat chicken in the marinade. Arrange chicken halves, cut-side down, in the bottom of the marinade bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from bowl, pat chicken dry with paper towels, and discard marinade. Place chicken halves, skin-side up, on a plate and season with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn chicken over, close the lid of the grill, and cook, basting with remaining barbeque sauce ever 6 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            
            
        </ol>
